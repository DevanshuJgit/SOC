### 1. Python for AI/ML

### 2. Python Libraries
    NumPy
    Pandas
    
### 3. Key Terminologies in AI/ML
    Features(inputs)
    Targets(outputs)
    Weights/Bias
    Loss/Cost Functions
    Gradient Descent
    Hyperparameters
    Ordinal Encoding
    
### 5. Types of Machine Learning
    Supervised: Uses labeled data (e.g., regression, classification)
    Unsupervised: finds patterns (e.g., clustering)
    Reinforcement: Learns via rewards and penalties

### 6. Supervised Learning
    Regression: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house price).
    Classification: Predicts categories (e.g., spam detection)
    
### 7. Model Improvement Techniques
    Overfitting: Model fits training data too well with training but not so good with testing.
    Underfitting: Model too simple it means poor predictions
    Regularization: Penalizes large weights to reduce overfitting
    Feature Scaling: Standardizes input ranges (Z-score, Min-Max)
    Feature Engineering: Creates new features (e.g., area = depth Ã— frontage)
